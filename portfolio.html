            <p>These are some examples of work I've done in a variety of mediums including creative 
                coding, 3D modeling, pen, watercolor, and photo editing. I have always had a 
                passionate interest in visual art and that led me to an interest in coding when I 
                started studying creative coding in community college back in the states. A big 
                part of why I chose to take the media design program at vic was because I would 
                be able to continue studying creative coding. While at vic I furthered knowledge 
                of creative coding through P5JS which helped segway me into interes in HTML and CSS. 
                I also started combining some of my coded work with image editing and exploring 3D modeling.

                <p>This is a piece I coded, the image is created by rotating a field of dots over 
                    the X, Y, and Z axis and the dots change color over time. I created an extensive 
                    series of images using this program rotating the dots different amounts over 
                    different axises and photographing the image at different stages.

                <p>This is an image from an art gallery I made in unreal engine. The idea was to 
                    make 3D versions of 2D artwork I had made previously. I made a space with 
                    three rooms each of which was a 3D modeled version of a 2D piece I had made 
                    previously.

                <p>This was a school project where we were assigned to make a poster for a hypothetical 
                    concert. As I used to make all the posters for my highschool band it felt right up 
                    my alley. I used pen and watercolor.

                <p>This is a photograph layered over a drawing I made with one of my drawing programs. 
                    This image was a screen shot from a glitch on facebook. I've always been fascinated 
                    with internet art, especially pieces that emphasize glitches or making something 
                    look like it's going wrong.

                <p>This was a school project in which I created an alphabet using fields of blacklines. 
                    There was a separate composition made for each letter in the alphabet.

                <p>This is a coded image I created when I was first learning creative coding. It is 
                    created by fields of lines overlapping in different colors. It displays pretty 
                    differently at different sizes with the lines creating different patterns.

                <p>This is a drawing I made with an old drawing program I wrote. Continuing 
                    on the theme of leaning into my mistakes I was trying to create a new brush 
                    and instead created these patterns of connecting lines. I ended up being much 
                    more interested in the mistake I had made than what I was originally trying 
                    to do and I now think it's one of the most interesting things you can do 
                    with the program.

                <p>This is a self portrait I did in pen when I first moved to New Zealand and was 
                    living in a depressing little hotel room. I was still looking for a job and 
                    didn't know anyone. Boy you can tell I was having a good time.

                <p>This piece is another example of trying to embrace a glitch or mistake. I was 
                    trying to make an erase function work with a new 3D element I had added to my 
                    program and the eraser was only eracing one layer on the z axis. I thought the 
                    result was pretty cool and I was never able to recreate it after this.

                <p>This is a drawing I did to be a joke tarot card. I had planned on making a full 
                    deck with silly characters but after this card took me many hours and I found 
                    out how many cards there are in tarot decks I decided against it.

                <p>This was a school project I did that focused on editing images in p5js. I used 
                    photo editing and code together to create distinctions between different areas 
                    of the photo. I think it's a good example of the end result being more than 
                    the sum of its parts as I had to take the photos locked down in my room, and 
                    I didn't like them very much, and the code I wrote was pretty simple but I ended 
                    up liking the final result.

                <p>This image is a stock photo layed over a drawing I created with an interactive drawing
                     program I wrote (the same drawing program you can access from the main page). The 
                     idea was to mix photographes with coded images to create a psychedelic effect.

              <p>This is a video of a program I wrote to draw a random composition based on specific 
                constraints. There are multiple different lines being drawn in different colors that 
                move in different ways. Some of the lines are constrained to different parts of the 
                screen or change their behavior based on the section of the screen they are on. The 
                result is a composition that is different every time but with a similar overarching 
                look.

              <p>This is a video of me using a drawing program I created. The lines are rotated around 
                the center and controlled using the arrow keys to create straight lines and get this 
                "tecno" effect. You can change the color of the line you're drawing with to be red, 
                blue, green, or white.
