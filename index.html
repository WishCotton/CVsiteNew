      <p>I'm Mavis and stuff, 24 years old, runaway American, who majored in Design Innovation. 
        I became interested in learning about Web Design because I love coded art and am fascinated 
        by the tech art scene. Studying Web Design in and out of University has given me a new 
        medium to explore these interests through and I'm excited to expand my knowledge even 
        further! This website is partially a portfolio but has predominantly been a tool to teach 
        myself more about coding in html and css so I can see what is possible in the medium. If 
        you want to see an interactive example of the kind of creative coding projects I like to 
        create you can click on the purple sidebar to the left and if you would like to see a 
        portfolio of my visual art you can click on the red box below.

        <p>I was in an indie rock band called The Snaz for 5 years in which I acted as a band member and manager.
             That doesn't have much to do with web design but it did give me experience planning 
             events, designing merch and promotional material, and organizing other people.

            <p>I have been working as a bartender, specifically in craft beer breweries and bars, 
                for the last 4 years. I have a lot of experience working on a team and I know way 
                too much about beer. I also have a lot of experience dealing with a wide range of 
                people and solving problems as they arise.
