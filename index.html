      <p>I'm Mavis and stuff, the 24 year old, runaway American, who majored in Design Innovation. 
        I became interested in learning about web design because I love coded art and am fascinated 
        by the tech art scene. Studying web design in and out of university has given me a new 
        medium to explore these interests through and I'm excited to expand my knowledge even 
        further! This website is partially a portfolio but has predominantly been a tool to teach 
        myself more about coding in html and css so I can see what is possible in the medium. If 
        you want to see an interactive example of the kind of creative coding projects I like to 
        create you can click on the purple sidebar to the left. If you would like to see a 
        portfolio of my visual art you can click on the red box below.

        <p>I was in an indie rock band, The Snaz, for 5 years in which I acted as keyboardist and manager.
             That doesn't have much to do with web design, but it did give me experience planning 
             events, designing merch and promotional material, and organizing other people.

            </div>
            <p>I have been working as a bartender, specifically in craft beer breweries and bars, 
                for the last 4 years. I have a lot of experience working in a team and working in 
                a fast paced, stressful enviornment. I also have a lot of experience dealing with a wide range of 
                people, solving problems as they arise. And I know way too much about beer.
